## Purpose
- Throughuot history, there were several special times & places when a confluence of artists or engineers grouped together to create something really great, that didn't just advance our evolution as a species, but also left many generations afterwards with so much joy & appreciation. Think of Paris in the time of Dada & Surrealism, London in the time of Russel & Wittgenstein, New York in the time of Warhol & the Velvet Underground or Palo Alto in the time of TCP/IP & Xerox PARC.

- However, there are many more examples of artists & engineers that didn't know about each other, even though they were working on the same things, so lost the opportunity to cross-polinate one another & create great things together.

- There are also very little examples of groups that created something great, but were able to encorporate as a business to make a living out of their passion. There's just a big gap between a self-organized group of creative people working on a project, and a company with full governance selling its products.

- With the Web, it's much easier today to discover others sharing the same passion or purpose, & group together. With Web3 in particular, it is also becoming easier to enable self-goverenance for the group & allow it to split the commercial value created, in a fair way.

- fromTeal is a digital place for artists, engineers & any other world changers, to group together & create great things, while fairly splitting the value created.



## Overview
fromTeal is a digital world (special-purpose metaverse) designed to enable 3 main functions, in a practical & effective way:
1. Help engineers, artists, scientists & entrepreneurs to discover like-minded others who share the same passion or purpose, & form a group to pursue that passion or purpose together
2. Once a group is formed, help them organize in a way that maximizes their freedom & creativity (just like a self-organized Hackathon team) while still maintaining a governance model that regulates decision making, conflict resolution and so on.
3. As the group work together, also keep tap of the equity share of each member, so that whenever they have profits or any other commercial liquidity, they can share it in a fair way.

### Discovery & group forming
To help the discovery of other like-minded people sharing the same passion or purpose, fromTeal organizes the digital world into Islands, Lots & Buildings, that are organized around different purposes, problems, art forms, technologies or research areas. This works just like in cities you have neighborhoods or streets concentrating fashion stores, car dealers, house decor stores, or restaurants, so that you can discover what you need by wondering around. Each Island is created for a specific purpose or passion, each lot within it is created for a more specific problem or area, & each building in a lot serves as the virtual HQ for a group working together.

### Organization & governance
fromTeal is leveraging a way of organization & governance known as Teal or Holacracy, that was proven to be very effective with companies & organization that maximize the freedom & creativity of their members, to achieve extraordinary results. The main principle behind this governance model is that if people are driven by the same purpose, you don't need to have managers telling them what to do, but instead you can assume they'll be able to self-manage & self-organize themselves towards achieving their purpose. This means that everyone can make decisions by themselves, as long as they ask for advice from other stakeholders. Having this level of freedom, essentially make everyone fully leverage their creativity & capabilities, as they're all working as owners & not employees following orders.

### Equity & splitting of value
fromTeal defines a way for groups working together to keep tap of the equity share of each member, by allowing them to earn equity tokens of the group, in proportion to their level of contribution. These equity tokens are solely recording the equity shares, so that whenever the group has commercial profits, or their IP or whole group is being acquired, they can split the value between them in a fair way. For now, these equity tokens aren't meant to facilitate trade or investment, so members can't transfer or sell them to others. The group can still award non-group members with equity tokens for their contribution, but it won't have liquidity until there is splitting of value.



## How it works
The fromTeal digital world is actually an information system with a new UI paradigm for working with information. Every entity in this information system is represented by a 3D object, whose state is managed in an L2 blockchain, facilitating the governance & equity functionality in a decentralized way. 

### Example scenario
- Chris is an engineer who's very passionate about fighting global climate change, & thought of a way to enable people & companies to capture CO2 in their home or offices
- He knows that it would require help from others to realize his project, as there are many problems to solve in order to make this way effective & practical 
- He goes to the fromTeal digital world, & enters the Island dedicated for the global climate change, where groups of people research different components of this problem
- He finds there a lot dedicated for CO2 capture, & sees there the HQ's of several groups working on projects for doing that
- None of these groups actually uses the methods Chris thought about, so he decides to start a new group, called "Planet A" & creates a virtual HQ for it
- fromTeal mints 1MM equity tokens for the Planet A group
- Chris starts working on the tasks, such as building a prototype & recruiting a scientist, & creates objects representing them in the HQ
- As tasks are completed, Chris updates their state, allowing fromTeal to track his level of contribution (e.g., completing on average a task per day, week or month).
- Chris level of contribution is 1 task per week, & based on this, fromTeal transfers every month 700 equity token to his balance
- Janet, another fromTeal user, visits the global climate change Island, & sees the task for recruiting a scientist. Since she has a frien scientist, Alan, who's very passionate about climate change as well, she refers Chris to Alan, who agrees to join the Planet A group
- Chris decides to grant Janet 100 equity tokens, as a reward for the referral
- Alan joins the group & starts working on tasks
- Every week, the 2 have a session working together
- fromTeal keeps track of both the task completion as well as the session attendance, & based on both, determines the level of contribution of each member, & accordingly their monthly earning of equity tokens
- As the team works on prototypes, they also have costs, which they share between them. fromTeal keeps track of contribution to costs, which also impacts the level of contribution
- After a year, the group adds couple more members, & finally builds a product with reasable effectiveness
- They decide to sell the product to people & companies through a web site, & after some time have initial profits
- fromTeal shows the equity tokens balance of each member, so they're able to split the profits according to the distribution of equity tokens

### Entities

| Entity | Description | Examples |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Purpose Island | - A neighborhood of teams all working towards a common purpose - something they want to change in the world. Islands can be created by everyone, & upon creation define their governance model. Islands with no activity, gets smaller every quarter ("sink"), while others with high activity grow ("rise"). | Climate change, Longevity, Visualizing big data |
| Need Lot | - A lot (enclosed area) created within an island, for a specific need or problem | Capturing CO2, Alerting on toxic jelly fish |
| Team | - A group of artists, engineers or any world changers, that share a similar purpose of creating or changing something in the world |  |
| Task | - A work item that helps the team towards their shared purpose |  |
| Session | - A virtual meeting between team members, for working towards their shared purpose |  |
| Cost | - An expanse that the group had as part of their work, covered by a team member |  |
| Member |  |  |
| Membership type | - A classification of members, automatically calculated every quarter, based on the average frequency of completing tasks, attending sessions or covering costs. Used to determine the number of ownership token earned by the member each month. Types include: *Daily* (completes/attends on average at least 1 task or session every week day), *Weekly*, *monthly*,  *Quarterly* & *Yearly*. |  |
| Team ownership token | - Earned every month, according to member membership type. Fixed amount minted up front. Can be granted by the team to a person by the team (major decision) |  |
