# FromTeal-whitepaper Raw Ideas


We want fromTeal to generate beauty & specifically Art, beautiful Art, in the world.

The way we want to that is this. 
There are many artists in the world, all persuing different types of art, for example, it may be some traditional art form, or it might be figuring out some solution to a problem that many people have, or building a new technology, 
or any other beautiful new thing that people create, that is so original, novel & beaufitful that people appreciate it & say: 
wow, this is something I never saw before, it's so simple & powerful, that it's just beautiful.

There are many people who do that, but there's even more beauty created when people collaborate.
It is just so that 1+1>2 many times. It may be when people drive each other to do something new, 
or that doing something together blends the different skills into something special or new,
or it just might be that someone had an idea that's exactly the missing piece for something someone else wanted to do,
so combining the ideas gives them something much bigger & more special.

So, there are many examples of where people created art in a group, creating something much bigger than what each one of them would have been able to create individually.

Given that, why aren't there more artist groups? And to be clear, we're speaking of an extended concept of art, it could be the Velvet Underground, or XEROX PARC, or Watson & Criek & (forgot her name).

So how is fromTeal going to help generate more beautiful art, & specifically by helping people create art groups, in which the sum is much bigger than it's parts?


fromTeal tries to do that using 3 layers:
1. *Maps* mapping purposes/problems to people/teams
2. *Digital world* for teams to collaborate & work together in
3. *Smart Contracts* infrastructure facilitating the teams' governance & finance


We need to help people to discover each other, & we need people working on some specific problem or need, to discover others working on the same problem or need.
And either group together or cross-polinate each other (even when not in the same group, they can still contribute & influence each other).

How do you help one artist/engineer/researcher working on something, discover another artist working on the same thing? And connect them.

So, fromTeal tries to do this in this way:
It offers a digital world, containing 4 main entities:
1. **Purpose Neighborhood**: areas built around some purpose - purpose can be "create songs from poetry on the extreme difficulties of modern life", or it can be "discover a way to capture CO2 from the atmosphere". Purposes can be very diverse & variful.
2. **Category Street**: areas for sub-categories within a purpose, in which problem lots are created.
3. **Problem Lot**: areas of lands, created around some specific problem, need or goal, within some purpose & category, in which team buildings can be built.
4. **Team Building**: a building for teams forming to work together on some problem or need

Any fromTeal user, can create any of these entities - neighborhoods, streets, lots or buildings, but is subject to moderation by fromTeal moderators, who try to ensure that anything created complies with the rules & standards for keeping the map effective & accurate.

A person passionate about some purpose, or having a certain problem or need, or actually working on some type of art, research or technology, will create the relevant purpose neighborhood, category street, problem lot or team building, if any of these do not yet exist. If the neighborhood, street or lot already exist, the person can join them as member, indicating that she is passionate about that purpose or having the relevant problem or need. If a team building already exists for exactly the same work as the person is doing, she may ask to join the team, or alternatively start her own team building on the same problem lot.

Besides the team buildings on problem lots, users can also create team booths for external teams or organizations, also working on the same problem, who do not use fromTeal. The booth will contain references to the external team communication channels (website, twitter &c), so that fromTeal can automatically update the booth with publications from the external teams.

Based on this digital world composed of purpose neighborhoods, category streets, problem lots & team buildings/booths, fromTeal offers a map of the relationship between pruposes/problems & people/teams/organizations working on them. This map can help anyone passionate about a specific purpose, problem or need, to discover others who share the same passion, & either learn from them or join them.
